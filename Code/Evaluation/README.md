### Evaluation Folder
This folder contains codes used for synthetic data evaluation and real-world RCT data evaluation. 
For synthetic data evaluation we adopted ITE measurement proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10550 
and the result is shown in Section 5.1. For offline test on real-word data, we adopted PMG method described in section 3,
corresponding to the result in Section 5.2.
