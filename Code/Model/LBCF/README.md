The steps for simulation data are as follow:

    unzip LBCF_Synthetic.zip
    python data_preprocessing.py
    follow instructions under ./LBCF_Synthetic for training and prediciton
    python LBCF_budget_allocation.py
    
The steps for RCT data are as follow:

    unzip LBCF_RCT.zip
    follow instructions under ./LBCF_RCT for training and prediciton
    python LBCF_budget_allocation-RCT.py
