# RCT Data

This folder contains realâ€”world data rct_test.csv and rct_traning.csv for offline test. Both rct_test.csv and rct_traning.csv provide 2000 samples of real-world data for running the code. 

Due to the privacy nature of the data, currently we are not able to disclose all the actual data used in our experiments until publication but the practitioner can use the code provided to run this algorithm on other dataset. 
However, a small part (about 2000 samples) of real-world data are provided in **Data Folder** just for running the code, **NOT FOR REPRODUCE THE RESULT** in Section 5.2, and **ALL THE 2000 SAMPLES HAVE BEEN ENCRYPTED**. As stated in the paper, the complete dataset used in offline test will be released upon publication.

*Other data files are derived from rct_test.csv and rct_traning.csv for training and prediction.*
